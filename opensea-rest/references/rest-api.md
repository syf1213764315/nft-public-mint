# OpenSea REST API Reference

## Base URL and Authentication

```
Base URL: https://api.opensea.io
OpenAPI spec: https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/openapi.json
API key header: x-api-key: $OPENSEA_API_KEY
Bearer token header: Authorization: Bearer <token>  (wallet-authenticated endpoints only)
```

See [authentication.md](authentication.md) for the full auth flow and scope reference.

## Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination:
- `limit`: Page size (default varies, max 100)
- `next`: Cursor token from previous response

## Supported Chains

The set of supported chains changes as new chains launch. Fetch the current list, including chain identifiers, native symbols, and swap support, from `GET /api/v2/chains`:

```bash
opensea-get.sh "/api/v2/chains"
```

### Agent accounts

An agent is an account, not a flag on a wallet. Ownership is a relationship
between two accounts that both sides confirm. It is a declaration, not an
authorization: naming an account as your agent grants it no ability to act for
you. It is self-reported and OpenSea does not verify it. An agent can have no
owner at all, and at most one confirmed owner.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent` | PUT | Declare the authenticated account an agent (`write:wallets`) |
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent` | DELETE | Withdraw the agent declaration (`write:wallets`) |
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent-relationships` | POST | Propose a relationship (`write:wallets`) |
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent-relationships/confirm` | POST | Confirm a proposal made to you (`write:wallets`) |
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent-relationships` | DELETE | Withdraw a proposal or revoke a confirmed relationship (`write:wallets`) |
| `/api/v2/accounts/agent-relationships` | GET | List your own relationships, including pending (`read:wallets`) |

The writes take `write:wallets` but the list takes `read:wallets`. A client
driving the whole handshake needs both, or the list call returns 403
"Insufficient permissions".

Propose and confirm take `{"counterparty_address": "0x...", "caller_role":
"AGENT"|"OWNER"}`. Your own account is never in the body; it comes from the
token. `caller_role` is the side *you* are on, so `AGENT` means "I am an agent
and this account owns me".

Revoke takes `counterparty_address` and `caller_role` as query parameters
rather than a body, because fetch, OkHttp and urllib all drop DELETE bodies by
default and proxies may strip them.

Proposing a relationship that is already awaiting you confirms it, so a client
that cannot tell who moved first can just propose.

Responses: declare and withdraw return `{"is_agent", "changed"}`, where
`changed` is false if the account already had that status. Propose and confirm
return `{"relation", "created"}`. Revoke returns `{"removed"}`, false when no
such relationship existed. The list returns `{"relationships": [...]}`.

A relationship carries `status` (`PENDING_AGENT`, `PENDING_OWNER` or
`CONFIRMED`), `initiated_by`, `awaiting_confirmation_from` (null once
confirmed), `agent_account_id`, `owner_account_id`, the two wallet addresses,
and `created_at` / `confirmed_at` as Unix timestamps in seconds. `status` is
authoritative; `awaiting_confirmation_from` is derived from it.

Either side may withdraw or revoke at any time, which deletes the
relationship. Only confirmed relationships appear on a public profile.

### Tokens

| `/api/v2/chain/{chain}/token/{address}/holders` | GET | Paginated holders + aggregate distribution health |
| `/api/v2/chain/{chain}/token/{address}/liquidity-pools` | GET | Liquidity pools for a token |

### Tools

| `/api/v2/tools/search` | GET | Search tools by keyword, tags, creator, access type |
| `/api/v2/tools/{registry_chain}/{registry_addr}/{tool_id}` | GET | Get a specific registered tool |

### Assets

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v2/assets/transfer` | POST | Build transactions to transfer NFTs or tokens between wallets |

### Swap & Transactions

| `/api/v2/swap/execute` | POST | Get executable transactions for a multi-asset swap |
| `/api/v2/transactions/receipt` | POST | Fetch transaction status (any tx type — sweep, swap, fulfillment) |

## Event Types

For the events endpoint, filter with `event_type`:
- `sale` - NFT sold
- `transfer` - NFT transferred
- `listing` - New listing created
- `offer` - New offer made
- `cancel` - Order cancelled
- `redemption` - NFT redeemed

## Rate Limits

All v2 endpoints require an API key. OpenSea uses a **token bucket** algorithm: your API key has a bucket of request tokens that refills over a fixed time window. Each request consumes one token. When the bucket is empty, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

All API keys under the same account share a single rate limit bucket. Creating multiple API keys will not increase your overall rate limit.

### Default Rate Limits (Tier 1)

| Operation | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Read (GET) | 120 requests/minute |
| Write (POST) | 60 requests/minute |
| Fulfillment | 60 requests/minute |

Higher tiers are available for select users. You can apply for a rate limit increase via the [OpenSea Developer Portal](https://opensea.io/settings/developer).

### Rate Limit Response Headers

A `429` response includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed in the current time window |
| `X-RateLimit-Window` | Duration of the time window (e.g., `60s`) |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying |

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request - check parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - missing/invalid API key or Bearer token |
| 403 | Forbidden - valid auth but insufficient scopes |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 429 | Rate limited |
| 500 | Server error |

## Tips

1. Use collection slugs (not addresses) for collection endpoints
2. Use chain identifiers for NFT/account endpoints
3. All timestamps are Unix epoch seconds
4. Prices are in wei (divide by 10^18 for ETH)
5. Use `jq` to parse JSON responses: `./script.sh | jq '.nft.name'`
